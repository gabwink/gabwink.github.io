# Professional Journey 
Experienced in education, behavioral, and robotics research, I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Dynamics, Control, Robotics, and Neural Engineering.

My interest in robotics was ignited during my role as a physics education research assistant. There, I developed and taught reverse classroom physics courses, fostering collaborative problem-solving through analytical techniques and computational modeling software. This experience honed my skills in presenting data and research in a professional manner, while also deepening my understanding and interest in electricity and magnetism concepts.

Building on this foundation, I transitioned into a medical physics research assistant role, merging my interests in physics, engineering, and biology.  In this role, I learned about medical imaging and external beam radiation treatment plans for radiation therapy with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Exposure to clinical service redirected my focus towards biomedical research and design.

Now, in my graduate school journey, I actively sought to integrate my diverse research background. Currently, I am delving into the algorithmic and neural basis of naturalistic decision-making. My research entails conducting behavioral experiments within the context of a dynamic interaction task involving animals and robots.

I am excited to contribute to the intersection of robotics and research, I am driven by a commitment to advancing knowledge and pushing the boundaries of innovation in the field.

# Leisure Pursuits

In my free time, I'm all about outdoor activities. I'm constantly on the lookout for pickup games or leagues in soccer or field hockey. I also love exploring state parks and hiking trails, often with my dog by my side. When winter arrives, you'll find me hitting the slopes for some skiing. And, let's not forget the ongoing adventure of exploring Chicagoâ€”I'm always on the hunt for great restaurants.

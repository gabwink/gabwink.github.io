## Particle Filter 
A particle filter implemented for a differential drive vehicle subject to the dynamics, 

```math
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{\theta} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} cos(\theta)u_1 \\ sin(\theta)u_1  \\ u_2  \end{bmatrix} , (x(0), y(0), \theta(0)) = (0, 0, \pi/2)
```

using dt = 0.1 and process noise and measurement noise normally distributed with a variance of 0.02.

### Result

Figure 1: Each color represents a snapshot of the particles at a particular time. The black line is the state estimate of x and y every dt seconds.
